## Installation

You can download the executable from https://sekuraapp.com. However, we strongly recommend you to build the executable from the code, following the next instructions.

### Build executable

* Install node and yarn.
* Execute `yarn`
* Execute `yarn buildExecutable`, it will create the executable under an `out` folder. Or execute `yarn start` if you don't want to create an executable.
